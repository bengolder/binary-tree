# node-btree

A Binary Tree object implemented in JavaScript.

This is currently not a public package. At this point this repo is primarily
used for the purpose of learning more about algorithms and JavaScript unit
testing. Eventually I hope to create a Red Black Tree and an Interval Tree.

If you're interested, please feel free to fork this, submit pull requests, or
just drop me a line.
