# js-btree

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bengolder/js-btree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bengolder/js-btree)

A Binary Tree object implemented in JavaScript.

This is currently not a public package. I'm using this as a personal project
to learn more about algorithms and JavaScript unit testing. 

If you'd like to use a public npm package containing Binary Trees and Red Black
trees, you can see [someone else's existing project here](https://github.com/vadimg/js_bintrees).

If you're interested, please feel free to fork this or drop me a line.
